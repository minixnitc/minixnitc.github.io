		<p>This project included in-depth understanding of Minix Operating System, especially the <a href="filesystem.html">File System</a> and implemetation of <a href="">Immediate Files</a>. This website is a detailed account of work done during 2014-2015 on this project. Here is a <a href="">link</a> to previous years work on this project. 
		<h4><a href="os.html">1.Understanding the Operating System</a></h4>
		<p>Prior to implemetation of imeediate files, it is recommended that one has a general idea on how the operating system work and go through some source code along with reading the book -Operating Systems: Design And Implementation 3rd Edition by Andrew Tanenbaum for a better understanding of the logic behind the design and ease in implementation of the target.</p>
		<h4><a href="roadmap.html">2.Roadmap for Implementation of Immediate File System</a></h4>
		<p>Immediate file system is basically a new feature included in file system to reduces the access time to the files. Implemetation deals with the changing the source code of minix file system to include immediate files.</p>
