		<h2>1. Understanding Relevant Code</h2>
		<p>Refer to <a href="os.html">operating system</a> and the links given in reference section of each page.<br>
		<p>LInk to the book</p>
		<h2>2. Design</h2>
		<p>
		There are two ways in which immediate files can be implemented in the minix operating system -<br>
		<b>Static :</b> In this approach, the maximum file size is specified at creation and you can't change the type of file once created. In case the immediate file size exceeds the specified size, it will report an error. This is can be implemented by creating a new file system.<br>
		<b>Dynamic :</b> A file is created as an immediate file and if size exceeds specified size, it becomes a regular file. To implement this approach, we need to make changes in the existing file system.<br>

		<b>Implementation in Dynamic Approach</b>: 
		To include immediate file system in an existing file system, the following sections are involved -
		<i>Data structures representing files</i>
		<i>Virtual File System</i>
		<i>Message Formats</i>
		<i>Minix File System </i> : in the funtions of the regular file system of minix, there is almost no change in create, open and close functions. The changes in read, write, delete are made so that if the file is immediate (which can be deduced by comparing size), then there is the content is to be accessed from the inode.</p>

		<h2>4. Installation and setting up the system</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Follow <a href="http://sudevambadi.me/MinixMajor/ref/install.html">this</a> link to install minix in virtual box</li>
			<li>Vi editor can be used to edit the code but if you need any other editior you can install it using <code>pkgin</code> or <code>pkgin_cd</code>. Refer the link above</li>
			<li>If installation is to be done by <code>pkgin_cd</code>, you must install virtual box extensions from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">here</a></li>
			<li>You might need to edit the <code>rc.conf</code>, if <code>pkgin_cd</code>is not working.</li>
			<li>To transfer your code to eclipse (most preferred), follow <a href="http://wiki.minix3.org/doku.php?id=developersguide:eclipsetutorial">this</a> link</li>
		</ul>


		<h2>5. Final Implementation - Coding</h2>
		<h2>File System Basic Structure</h2>

		<p>The <code> /usr/src/servers/mfs </code> directory contains the source code for FS in
		minx3.2 operating system. Some of the important files in mfs are <code>main.c, in-
		ode.h, open.c, write.c, buf.h, super.h, super.c </code> etc. The main function of
		each file in mfs are listed below:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> buf.h - Defines the block cache. It contains a union named fsdata u
			with following attributes:
				<ul>
					<li> b data[MAX BLOCK SIZE], a character array, containing ordinary user data.<li>
					<li> b dir[NR DIR ENTRIES( MAX BLOCK SIZE)] - directory block</li>
					<li> b bitmap[[FS BITMAP CHUNKS( MAX BLOCK SIZE)]] - bitmap block</li>
					<li> direct and indirect inode blocks</li>
				</ul>
			<li>cache.c - FS has a buffer cache to reduce the number of disk accesses. File contains 9 procedures, few of them are listed below.
				<ul>
					<li> get block - Fetch a block for reading/writing.</li>
					<li> put block - Return a block</li>
					<li> rw block - Transfer block between disk and cache</li>
					<li>free zone - If file is deleted, free the zone</li>
				</ul>
			<li> const.h - Defines constants, like flags, table size that will be used in
			the file system. Few constants are, IN CLEAN, IN DIRTY, ATIME,
			CTIME etc </li>
			<li> fs.h - Master header for FS, includes all header files needed by the MFS
			source files </li>
			<li> glo.h - Defines all the global variables. Few examples of global variables
			are fs m in, fs m out, err code, fs dev, user path[PATH MAX]
			etc. </li>
			<li> inode.h - Contains the stucucture for inode and the inode table as in-
			ode[NR INODES] </li>
			<li> inode.c - Contains functions which manages the inode table. The func-
			tions are get inode(), put inode(), rw inode(), alloc inode() etc</li>
			<li> main.c - Contains the main routiene of the file system. The main loop
			does three activities</li>
			<ul>
			<li> get work(&fs_m_in) - Gets a new work </li>
			<li> Processes the work i.e. selects the fuction to be called to complete
			the work and calls it from the table of function pointers.</li>
			<li> reply(src, &fs_m_out) - Sends a reply</li>
			</ul>
			<li> open.c - Contains the codes for six system calls:open, close, mknode,
			mkdir, close, lseek </li>
			<li>proto.h - Lists all function prototypes for all functions used in MFS</li>
			<li> read.c - All functions that are used for reading or writing are present in
			read.c. Some of the functions include, fs readwrite, rw chunk, read map
			etc.</li>
			<li>super.h - Contains the superblock table. Super block holds information
			about inode bitmap, zone bitmaps, inodes etc.</li>
			<li> super.c - Handles the superblock table and other related data structures
			like zone bitmap, inode bitmap etc. Major functions in this file are: al-
			loc bit(), free bit(), get super(), read super() etc.</li>
			<li> table.c - Contains the table that map system call numbers onto the rou-
			tines.</li>
			<li> write.c - Contains files that are not in read.c but are necessary for writing
			in a file. Most important functions in write.c are write map, clear zone,
			new block and zero block</li>
		</ul>




		<h3>Data Structures Involved</h3>
		<h4>Inode</h4>
		<p>
		we can see that there are 7 zones of 4 bytes each, an indirect
		zone of size 4 bytes, a double indirect node of size 4 bytes and an unused
		space of 4 bytes. Each zone points to a disk block where actual data gets
		stored. According to definition of immediate files we had to find a space
		in the inode where we can store the immediate files. These zones are apt
		place to store the immediate files because no data which is critical to the
		file is being affected. We calcualted maximum size of immediate files as
		40 bytes by adding up sizes of all zones, indirect zones and unused space.
		<br>
		<img src="images/inode.png">
		<br>
		<code>max size = zn sz X 7 + ud sz + idt sz + ddt sz </code><br>
		<code> max size = 4 X 7 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 40bytes </code>
		</p>
		<h4>buffer or block cache</h4>
		This is a union of different types of blocks in the
		disk. Eg. normal data block, directory block, inode block, bitmap block
		etc. The design of buffer or block cache is given below.
		<img src="images/buffer.png">
		b data array is used to cache the data which is stored in the disk block,
		all the modifications by the user are done here and then the data is written
		back to the disk. b data(b) is a macro which returns the pointer to the
		first byte of b data array.</p>
		<h4>message</h4>
		<img src="images/message.png">
		<p>
		mess 1, mess 2, mess 3, . . . are different message types. In MFS,
		global variables, fs m in and fs m out, of type message are used to
		send and recieve messages from various servers like VFS. Following system
		calls are used for message passing: echo, notify, sendrec, receive, send.
		</p>

		<h3>Files Involved</h3>
		<p>
			List of all files in which codes are added or deleted.
			<ul>
		<li>	/src/include/const.h - A new flag I IMMEDIATE is created to sup-
		port immediate files </li>
		<li> src/sys/lib/libsa/minixfs3.h - A new flag I IMMEDIATE is created
		to support immediate files </li>
		<li> /src/servers/vfs/open.c - When O CREATE flag is set. Set the file
		mode as immediate instead of regular. It will have size zero.</li>
		<img src ="code1.png">
		<li>src/sys/sys/stat.h - Following additions are done in this file:
		<ul>
		<li>S_IFIMMED - macro was defined, similar to regular files<br>
		<code>#define
		S_IFIMMED 0130000</code><br></li>
		<li>S_IFIMMED - macro redifined for easier usage, similar to regular
		files.<br>
		<code>#define S_IFIMMED S_IFIMMED</code></li>
		<li>S_ISIMMED(m) - macro defined which checks whether a files is
		immediate or not (similar to regular files)<br>
		<code>#define S_ISIMMED(m) ( ( (m) & S IFMT ) == S IFIMMED )</code></li>
		<li>There are 114 more files where we have located S ISREG(m) and added
		S ISIMMED(m) also in the code, because regular files and immediate
		files have same functionalities except that immediate files are stored in
		inode and regular files are stored in disk blocks pointed by zones in the
		inode. Few of the files are listed below:
		<ul>
		<li> /servers/vfs/select.c </li>
		<li> /servers/vfs/link.c</li>
		<li> /servers/vfs/read.c</li>
		<li> /commands/grep/mmfile.c ... etc</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>/src/severs/mfs/read.c - Major changes/addition for implementation of
		immediate file system is done in this file, in the fs readwrite() function<br>
		<img src="ca.png"><br>
		<img src="cb.png"><br>
		<img src="cc.png"><br>
		</li>
		</ul>
